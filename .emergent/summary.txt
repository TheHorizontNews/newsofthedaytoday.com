The previous AI engineer meticulously built the Edge Chronicle application, transforming it from an MVP to a feature-rich news platform. Initially, the task involved providing the complete codebase file-by-file, which was a challenging process due to repeated misidentification of already shared files. This led to a crucial user-provided file manifest, which streamlined the export of the remaining backend configuration, dependencies, and frontend admin components.

Subsequently, the project entered a significant feature development phase, driven by user requests for rebranding to Science Digest News with a specific blue color scheme and content adaptation. This involved extensive modifications to core frontend components for visual identity and thematic alignment. A major technical hurdle emerged during deployment attempts on the Emergent platform, signaled by a 503 Service Unavailable error. Debugging revealed MongoDB authorization issues, prompting the user to request a migration to SQLite for simpler deployment and database management. The AI engineer successfully orchestrated this complex backend migration, rewriting database interactions and API routes.

The final phase focused on refining the user experience, tackling remaining admin panel issues (SEO analytics, article editor, tags), implementing comprehensive Ukrainian localization for both frontend and admin areas, and critically, optimizing site performance to achieve a PageSpeed score of 100. Despite minor persistent challenges with the  component's complexity (initially due to , then general rendering issues), the engineer consistently iterated, aiming for a fully functional solution, demonstrating a robust problem-solving trajectory.

The Edge Chronicle project aimed to replicate the TSN.ua frontend design, evolving into a full-stack news application. The initial development included a pixel-perfect frontend clone with an article page, followed by rebranding to Edge Chronicle. A comprehensive full-stack admin panel (FastAPI backend, React frontend) was implemented for content, user, and category management, featuring JWT authentication, role-based access, a rich text editor, image upload, media library, and SEO metadata fields. Phase 4 completed SEO & Search Optimization, integrating Google Analytics/Search Console, tag management, and automatic sitemap/robots.txt/llms.txt generation.

Current requirements shifted to a new rebranding to Science Digest News with a specific blue color scheme (#0c61cf) and a scientific content theme. Post-rebranding, the user requested debugging deployment issues (Error 503), leading to a critical decision to migrate the backend database from MongoDB to SQLite for simplified setup and operation. The final set of explicit requirements involved fixing remaining admin panel issues (specifically SEO Analytics: Failed to fetch analytics data, ArticleEditor: still not loading, Tags: not displayed), achieving a PageSpeed score of 100, and implementing full Ukrainian localization for both the main site and the admin panel.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was working on resolving the persistent issues with the  component within the admin panel. This component had been problematic due to conflicts with the  library, leading to it being temporarily replaced with a non-functional informational page, then a simpler .

The user explicitly requested to доработай (finish) the . In response, the AI engineer has just created a new file:
-   : This is intended to be a fully functional, but simpler, article editor that avoids the previous  conflicts. The goal is to make the article creation/editing functionality fully operational again.

The very last action in the trajectory was the creation of this  file, and the AI engineer's next step is to integrate this new component into the  routes to make it the active article editor.

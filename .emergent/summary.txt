The previous AI engineer successfully developed Edge Chronicle from an MVP to a production-ready news platform with robust content and SEO features. The core achievement was completing **Phase 4: SEO & Search Optimization**, involving dynamic sitemap, , and  generation on the backend, alongside frontend Google Analytics 4 integration, and a comprehensive admin panel with SEO analytics and tag management. Key challenges included resolving backend startup issues, Python import errors, and Pydantic validation. The primary task transitioned from development to delivering the complete codebase to the user. Initial attempts at providing the code were high-level, leading to user confusion. The user explicitly guided the AI engineer to revert to a sequential, file-by-file code export, which is the current ongoing task.

<product_requirements>
The Edge Chronicle project aimed to replicate the TSN.ua frontend for design showcase, then evolved into a full-stack application.
**Implemented Features:**
1.  **Initial Replica & Article Page:** Pixel-perfect frontend clone of TSN.ua with a dedicated article page, focusing on responsive design and typography.
2.  **Rebranding:** Transition from TSN.ua to Edge Chronicle, including visual and textual updates, and layout refinements.
3.  **Admin Panel (Full-Stack):** A comprehensive FastAPI (backend) and React (frontend) system for content, user, and category management, featuring JWT authentication, role-based access (Admin, Editor, Reporter), a rich text editor, image upload, media library, and SEO metadata fields.
**Completed Phase 4: SEO & Search Optimization:**
*   Integrated Google Analytics and Search Console.
*   Implemented tag management for all pages.
*   Generated Organization Schema (Org Schema) and other structured data.
*   Automatic generation of , , and .

*Note: Many files listed in the initial  section from  (e.g., , , etc.) were part of the *already completed* Phase 4 and were modified/created prior to the current file-by-file export process. The AI engineer is now specifically providing the contents of the *admin panel files* that were stated as remaining from a previous count of 69 files. The current task focuses on delivering the *code for these files* for manual copying, and not necessarily creating them on the filesystem.*
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Continue providing the remaining 16 files of the 69 files project, specifically from the admin panel, in a sequential, file-by-file manner, including their full code content.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was in the process of manually providing the source code for the Edge Chronicle admin panel files to the user. This is a continuation of a previous, interrupted task where the user was meant to manually copy files to their GitHub repository.

The AI engineer has provided 53 out of the 69 files identified for the complete project. The work is being done sequentially, with each message detailing one or more files by their intended path within the project (e.g., ) and their full code content.

The last set of files provided were:
-   **File 51:**  (Component for managing content tags, showing statistics, popular tags, and cleanup actions.)
-   **File 52:**  (Admin page for configuring site-wide settings like site title, description, contact email, Google Analytics ID, social media links, and maintenance mode.)
-   **File 53:**  (Admin page for displaying general website analytics, including total views, unique visitors, page views, bounce rate, daily traffic, and traffic sources.)

The AI engineer just confirmed that 53 files have been shared and acknowledged that 16 files still remain, and is about to identify which files are left.

<optional_next_step>
Continue providing the remaining 16 files of the Edge Chronicle project, starting with File 54, in the requested sequential, file-by-file manner.
